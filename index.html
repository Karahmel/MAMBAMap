    <li><span>Hey guys! We know it is overwhelming to be move to a new city, leave your jobs, and start the program all at one time, so we wanted to help as much as possible with the housing search. Baltimore and DC are both cities of neighborhoods, so depending on your needs and preferences, you could end up North, South, East, or West of campus and be very satisfied.<br></br><br>If you have any questions about specific areas or properties, email me at ksalaets@mica.edu and I can connect you with the MAMBA who lived there. You can also email with general questions about the area or with suggestions for what else to inclue on these maps. Cheers to a smooth transition!</li>
