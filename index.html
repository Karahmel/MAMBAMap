 <h1>Hey Guys!</h1>
  <ul class="posts">
    <li><span>We know it is overwhelming to move to a new city, leave your job, leave your friends, and start the program all at one time, so we wanted to help as much as possible with the housing search. Baltimore is a city of neighborhoods, so depending on your personal needs and preferences, your ideal home could be almost anywhere in the city.<br></br>If you have any questions about specific neighborhoods or properties, email me at ksalaets@mica.edu and I can connect you with the MAMBA who lived there. You can also email with general questions about the area or with suggestions for what else to inclue on these maps. <br></br>Cheers to a smooth transition!</li>
