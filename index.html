 <h1>Hey Guys!</h1>
  <ul class="posts">
    <li><span>We know it is overwhelming to move to a new city, leave your job, leave your friends, and start the program all at one time, so we wanted to help as much as possible with the housing search. Baltimore is a city of neighborhoods, so depending on your personal needs and preferences, your ideal home could be almost anywhere in the city.<br></br>If you have any questions about specific neighborhoods or properties, email me at ksalaets@mica.edu and I can connect you with the MAMBA who lived there. You can also email with general questions about the area or with suggestions for what else to inclue on these maps. <br></br>Cheers to a smooth transition!</li>

  <h1>A few things we wish we'd known before signing that lease:</h1>
  <h5>
  1) How to get around on public transport.<br>
  2) To live close to Carey and in a safe area. Ideally close to the water.<br>
  3) To not live with other MA/MBAs. You will share plenty of time with them during classes and personal projects.<br>
  4) The intensity of racial tension and segregation in Baltimore.<br>
  5) Where the younger, artsy, likeminded people live. In my opinion, that is Mt. Vernon, Waverly, and Charles Village.<br>
  6) [From a DC MAMBA]- We debated moving to Baltimore and looked for a job for my SO - we ended up staying [in DC] because we are in a pretty good situation and it made sense. If all classes were in Baltimore we would have moved.<br>
  7) [From a DC MAMBA]- Comparison of pricing between living in DC and NYC. Commute times from DC to MICA/Carey (in DC and Baltimore). Commute times and costs of living in Baltimore.<br>
  8) I wish I knew more about the Baltimore neighborhoods in advance, and the average price of places in the city. I didn't have much comparison for the prices I was seeing. Also, something I used a bit for finding a spot to live in SF was LiveLovely. It's like craigslist but way easier to understand neighborhoods, and way prettier. Baltimore's on it now, too! livelovely.com<br>
  9) [From a Mt. Vernon resident] Remember to read the parking signs and times. Do not get your car towed like me.<br>
  10) That housing deals can be found and you just have to look. I still think I live in the right neighborhood for me, but it's a bit expensive for one.<br>
