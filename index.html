 <h1>Hey MAMBAs! We designed this site to help you find the charm city neighborhood that best aligns with your needs.</h1>
  <ul class="posts">
    <li><span><br>The maps below were designed using mapbox to give you a better picture of Baltimore before you move here in July. We've also included other advice from MAMBAs, especially what they wish they had known about Baltimore when they began their housing search.</br>If you have any questions about a specific area/property, email me at ksalaets@mica.edu and I can connect you with the MAMBA who lived there. You can also email if you have general questions about Baltimore or suggestions for what else we should add to this map. Happy house hunting!</li>
